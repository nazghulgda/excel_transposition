Many times I've did a mistake, and made an excel files with 'vertical' (column-like) records, instead of 'horizontal' (row-like).
I've also worked with such written data files in excel, so decided to make a small script, wich will fix this problem, and
transpose records in excel files.

TODO:

- ~~make the script running through all sheets in excel file~~
<<<<<<< HEAD
- ~~script have to ask for file name (instead putting a file name in code)~~

- script have to ask for file name (instead putting a file name in code)

- future - script recognizes all excel files in folder and asks (one by one) whch has to be transposed
